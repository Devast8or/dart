   - Tournament brackets visualization
   - Save/resume functionality

4. **Match Simulation**
   - Realistic dart scoring and rules
   - Multiple player combination support

5. **Rankings & Leaderboards**
   - Prize money-based ranking
   - Season summaries

6. **Season Management**
   - Aggregate tournament results
   - Season reset functionality

7. **Prize Money Management**
   - Prize pool setup
   - Automatic distribution
   - Prize history

8. **Analytics & Reporting**

### Backend Structure
- Node.js with Express.js
- SQLite database using better-sqlite3
- RESTful API endpoints for all features

## Implementation Approach
We'll follow an incremental implementation approach focusing on core features first:

1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Setup project structure and boilerplate
   - Implement basic UI components
   - Create data models and schemas

2. **Phase 2: User & Player Management**
   - User registration and login
   - Player profiles (human and AI)
   - Basic statistics tracking

3. **Phase 3: Tournament & Match Features**
   - Tournament creation and management
   - Match simulation with dart rules
   - Tournament brackets visualization

4. **Phase 4: Analytics & Season Management**
   - Rankings and leaderboards
   - Season management
   - Prize money management

5. **Phase 5: Refinement & Enhancement**
   - Responsive design improvements
   - Analytics and reporting features
   - Performance optimization

## Next Steps
1. Complete setup of frontend component structure
2. Implement initial UI components (Navbar, Dashboard)
3. Create user registration and login functionality
4. Develop player database models and views
5. Implement basic tournament creation flow

## Known Issues
None at this stage as we're initiating the project.

## TODOs
1. Create frontend scaffolding and component structure
2. Setup CSS modules and SCSS organization
3. Implement backend server and database connection
4. Develop authentication system
5. Create initial player models and interfaces
6. Design tournament management system
7. Implement match simulation engine with dart rules

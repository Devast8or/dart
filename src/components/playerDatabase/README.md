# README for Player Database Components

## Overview
The Player Database module is responsible for managing player profiles, including both human and AI players. It provides components to display player information and statistics, facilitating user interaction with player data.

## Components
- **HumanPlayerProfile.js**: Displays detailed profiles for human players, including personal statistics and history.
- **AIPlayerProfile.js**: Displays profiles for AI players, showcasing their skill levels and performance metrics.
- **PlayerStats.js**: Provides a comprehensive view of player statistics, including wins, losses, averages, and other relevant data.

## Usage
To utilize the Player Database components, import them into your desired module as follows:

```javascript
import HumanPlayerProfile from './HumanPlayerProfile';
import AIPlayerProfile from './AIPlayerProfile';
import PlayerStats from './PlayerStats';
```

## Styling
The components use CSS modules for styling, defined in `playerDatabase.module.scss`. Ensure to import the styles in each component to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional features for player comparison.
- Enhance the AI player profiles with more detailed analytics.
- Integrate player profiles with tournament management for better tracking of player performance.

## Notes

# Match Simulation Component Documentation

This README file provides an overview of the Match Simulation component within the Dart Season Simulation platform. The Match Simulation component is responsible for simulating matches between players, adhering to the rules of dart scoring and gameplay.

## Component Overview

### MatchSimulator.js
- **Purpose**: This component handles the logic for simulating matches between players, including both human and AI participants.
- **Key Features**:
  - Simulates match outcomes based on dart rules.
  - Supports various player combinations (human vs AI, AI vs AI, human vs human).

### DartRules.js
- **Purpose**: This module contains the rules and scoring logic for the dart matches.
- **Key Features**:
  - Defines scoring rules and gameplay mechanics.
  - Provides utility functions for calculating scores and determining match outcomes.

## Usage

To use the Match Simulation component, import the `MatchSimulator` and `DartRules` modules in your application where match simulation is required.

```javascript
import MatchSimulator from './MatchSimulator';
import { calculateScore, determineWinner } from './DartRules';
```

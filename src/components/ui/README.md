# UI Components Documentation

This directory contains the UI components for the Dart Season Simulation platform. The components are designed to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface for the application.

## Components Overview

1. **Dashboard.js**: 
   - This component serves as the main interface for users, displaying key statistics and navigation options.

2. **Navbar.js**: 
   - This component provides navigation links to different sections of the application, ensuring easy access for users.

3. **ResponsiveLayout.js**: 
   - This component manages the layout of the application, ensuring that it is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Styling

The UI components utilize the `ui.module.scss` file for styling, which follows the CSS Modules methodology to ensure scoped styles and avoid conflicts.

## Usage

To use these components, import them into your main application file or other components as needed. Ensure that the corresponding styles are also imported to maintain the intended design.

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding more UI components as the application grows, such as modals, tooltips, or additional navigation elements to enhance user experience.

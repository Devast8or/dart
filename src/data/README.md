# This file provides documentation for the data files used in the dart season simulation platform.

## Overview
The `data` directory contains mock data files that are used for testing and development purposes. These files simulate player profiles and tournament information, allowing developers to work on the application without needing a fully functional backend.

## Files

### 1. `mockPlayers.js`
This file contains mock data for human and AI player profiles. It includes attributes such as player names, skill levels, statistics, and history.

### 2. `mockTournaments.js`
This file contains mock data for various tournament formats. It includes details such as tournament names, formats (knockout, round-robin, etc.), participant lists, and results.

## Usage
These mock data files can be imported into components or utilities where player or tournament data is required. They are particularly useful for testing UI components and ensuring that the application behaves as expected with different data scenarios.

## Note
The mock data is not intended for production use and should be replaced with real data from the backend once the API is implemented.
